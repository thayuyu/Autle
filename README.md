# Autle

## What is it?
Autle is a web game where car fanatics can guess their favourite cars or car manufacturers.

## Different gamemodes!
Autle has 3 different gammodes. The classic Autle which is the well known wordle but instead of guessing words, you guess cars, as hints you have the information of the cars you just guessed and how far you are from the secret car. Manufacturer mode, where you get a logo, depending on the difficulty, differently edited / distorted, and have to guess which one it is. The last mode is with fictional cars from the game Grand Theft Auto V, with different information than the classic Autle.
